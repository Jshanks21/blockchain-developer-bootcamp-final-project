# Final Project - NFT Stake

## Boiled Down:
1. An app that allows users to stake their NFTs
2. Stakers will receive a yet undetermined amount of ERC-20 tokens for the duration of their stake
   - Simplest implementation will use a newly deployed ERC-20 testnet token

## Extras:
- Stakers can unstake at any time (consider enforced durations for staking?)
- Staked NFTs can be lent out to others
- Stakers/Lenders can set a price and duration for lending out the NFT (unused time and funds are claimable by lendee? continuous stream? or paid daily, weekly, etc?)
- Staked NFTs will have gated content they unlock using mintgate.io for lendees to access
- Stakers/Lenders can claim all funds from lending over the course of their stake after the NFT is unstaked (available for unstaking?)
